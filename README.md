# DreamCatcher

DreamCatcher is a web application that tries to detect whether a person in a photo is awake or asleep.
Our purpose for doing so is to provide an empirical basis to determine how many people in a classroom are engaged.

This project was made at YHack 2017 by Steven Wong, Jeffrey Kam, Kevin Xiang, and Tanvir Shahriar.
