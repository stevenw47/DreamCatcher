# DreamCatcher

DreamCatcher is a web application that tries to detect whether people in a photo are awake or asleep.
Our purpose for doing so is to provide an empirical basis to determine the engagement in a classroom environment.

This project was made at YHack 2017 by Steven Wong, Jeffrey Kam, Kevin Xiang, and Tanvir Shahriar.
